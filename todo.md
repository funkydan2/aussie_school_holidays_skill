# To-Do
* Card Output
  * Is {date} a holiday?: '{Date} is a school day/holiday.'
    * Maybe it could also explain why a day is a holiday (it's the weekend, it's X public holiday, it's not term time.)
  * How Long: 'There are X calendar days and Y school days until the holidays.'
* Look into
  * South Australia
  * Tasmania
  * Western Australia
  * ACT and NT
* For QLD:
  * Deal with the staggered year ending for grades 10-12
* More fun responses!
