Queensland School Holidays Alexa Skill
=========================

Using publicly accessible data this skill allows users to ask whether a particular day is a holiday, or how long until the end of the next term.

Data is from:
* Qld Government (used under CC By 4.0 license)
* NSW Government (used under CC By 4.0 license)
* http://public-holidays.dteoh.com

This skill is available [for Australian Alexa users](https://www.amazon.com.au/Daniel-Saunders-Queensland-School-Holidays/dp/B07B8ZQLMK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1521263206&sr=1-1&keywords=aussie+holidays).

There is a [feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/vrJVk2lb8mQu8X0E2) for bug reports or feature requests.
